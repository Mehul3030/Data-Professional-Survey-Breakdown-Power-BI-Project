# Data-Professional-Survey-Breakdown-Power-BI-Project

## Data Professional Survey Breakdown - Power BI Dashboard

## Overview

This project presents a Power BI dashboard analyzing data from a survey of data professionals. The dashboard provides insights into demographics, salary, job satisfaction, and favorite programming languages within the data science community.

## Key Visualizations

The dashboard includes the following key visualizations:

*   **Country of Survey Takers:** A treemap showing the distribution of survey respondents by country. The largest groups are from the United States and India.
*   **Average Salary by Job Title:** A bar chart displaying the average salary for different data-related job titles (e.g., Data Scientist, Data Engineer, Data Analyst). This allows for comparison of compensation across roles.
*   **Count of Survey Takers & Average Age:** Key metrics displaying the total number of survey respondents (630) and their average age (29.87).
*   **Happy With Work/Life Balance:** A gauge chart illustrating the average satisfaction level with work-life balance (5.74 out of 10).
*   **Happy With Salary:** A gauge chart depicting the average satisfaction level with salary (4.27 out of 10).  This indicates lower satisfaction than with work/life balance.
*   **Favorite Programming Language:** A stacked column chart illustrating the popularity of different programming languages (Python, R, etc.) among data professionals. Python is shown to be the most popular.
*   **Average Salary by Gender:** A donut chart illustrating the split by average salary for each gender.
*   **Q7 - How Difficult?**: A pie chart depicting how difficult the survey takers think their job is.

## Key Insights

Based on the dashboard, some key insights include:

*   The survey respondents are primarily from the United States and India.
*   Data Scientists and Data Engineers tend to have higher average salaries.
*   Python is the most popular programming language among data professionals.
*   Overall satisfaction with salary is lower than satisfaction with work-life balance, suggesting a potential area for improvement within the industry.
* Average difficulty with their job

## Tools Used

*   **Power BI:** Used to create the interactive dashboard and visualizations.
*   **Excel:** Used for data cleaning and preprocessing.

## Data Source

* The data for this project was sourced from a publicly available dataset on survey website = 

## How to Use This Repository

This repository primarily contains:

*   [**Screenshot of the Dashboard:**  A visual representation of the Power BI dashboard.
## Future Enhancements

*   Implement interactive filters and slicers to allow users to explore the data in more detail.
*   Add more detailed visualizations to explore relationships between different variables (e.g., salary vs. experience).
*   Incorporate additional data sources to enrich the analysis.
*   Adding other year's data for comparison
